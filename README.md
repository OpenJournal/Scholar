## Mission

There are several [institutions and individuals](institutions.md) working to
create a universal repository of all open-access knowledge. There are few forums
for coordinating our efforts. OpenJournal is a working group which meets digitally
once a month to facilitate check-ins between institutions, openly discuss
blockers and issues, enable effective collaboration and distribution of efforts,
and to discuss standards and tools for improving the academic publishing
ecosystem.

You can read more about our [long-term goals and mission](mission.md).

## How it works

We facilitate an online meeting approximately once a month to help institutions share their progress, synchronize their efforts (reduce redundant efforts), discuss blockers, and acquire the resources they need to be succesful. We use github to centralize and coordinate our organization, so we can then decentralize our efforts.
