## Mission

There are several [institutions and individuals](institutions.md) working to
create a universal repository of all open-access knowledge. There are few forums
for coordinating our efforts. Scholar is a working group which meets digitally
once a month to facilitate check-ins between institutions, openly discuss
blockers and issues, enable effective collaboration and distribution of efforts,
and to discuss standards and tools for improving the academic publishing
ecosystem.
