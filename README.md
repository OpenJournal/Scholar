# Scholar

Universalizing Open-Access Journals & Papers

## Mission

There are several [institutions and individuals](institutions.md) working to
create a universal repository of all open-access knowledge. There are few forums
for coordinating our efforts. Scholar is a working group which meets digitally
once a month to facilitate check-ins between institutions, openly discuss
blockers and issues, enable effective collaboration and distribution of efforts,
and to discuss standards and tools for improving the academic publishing
ecosystem.

You can read more about our [long-term goals and mission](mission.md).
