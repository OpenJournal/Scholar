# Contributing

The success of OpenJournal relies on volunteers to help maintain this repository, to reach out and inform institutions, and to organize and coordinate community initiatives across institutions.

[Volunteer](https://github.com/OpenJournal/central/issues/7) towards one of our existing needs or [propose](https://github.com/OpenJournal/central/issues/7) a different way you'd like to get involved. We'll try to support you either way!
