# Coverage

Collaboratively outlining our coverage of academic source and determining which sources are missing or incomplete.

| Source | Coverage |

| Pubmed | ? | 

Here's a map of many archives: http://maps.repository66.org/

Note: [BASE](www.base-search.net/about/en/about_sources_date_dn.php?menu=2), [openarchives](https://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites), and others have a listing of their "sources". I plan to write a script which aggregates all of these into a single list.
