# Mission

Towards a living, disaster-tolerant, literate, more open, and technology-augmented ecosystem for academic publishing, which features:

- Permanence & Survival of Academic Papers
- A fresh/current, public, and unified index of open-access academic papers
- Programatic access to research papers for research & discovery, and to support creation of academic tools
- Facilitating comprehensive and reproducible research, where data, code, procedures, and results are published all together
- Promoting academic conversation, annotation, forking, and respectful republishing
- Encouraging publishing in metadata and semantically rich formats, as opposed to PDF
